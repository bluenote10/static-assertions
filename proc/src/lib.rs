//!
//! Procedural macro [compile-time] assertions as an extension of
//! [`static_assertions`].
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! There's two main ways of using this crate: as a direct dependency or
//! indirect dependency (via [`static_assertions`]).
//!
//! ## Direct Dependency
//!
//! This crate is available [on crates.io][crate] and can be used by adding the
//! following to your project's [`Cargo.toml`]:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! proc_static_assertions = "0.0.0"
//! ```
//!
//! and this to your crate root (`main.rs` or `lib.rs`):
//!
//! ```
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate proc_static_assertions;
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! ## Indirect Dependency
//!
//! Add the following to your project's [`Cargo.toml`]:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! static_assertions = { version = "1.1.0", features = ["proc"] }
//! ```
//!
//! and this to your crate root (`main.rs` or `lib.rs`):
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate static_assertions;
//! ```
//!
//! This will also import all macros in `proc_static_assertions`.
//!
//! # Donate
//!
//! This project is made freely available (as in free beer), but unfortunately
//! not all beer is free! So, if you would like to buy me a beer (or coffee or
//! *more*), then consider supporting my work that's benefited your project
//! and thousands of others.
